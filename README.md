# Bus Management System App - Read Me

## Introduction

Welcome to the Bus Management System Android app! This app is designed to provide a convenient way for teachers to manage bus details and for students to track buses' real-time location and estimated time of arrival (ETA).

## Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the requirements for the Bus Management System app. It aims to outline the features and functionalities of the app, as well as the specific requirements for its development and implementation.

## Scope

The Bus Management System app will cater to two main roles: teachers and students. Teachers will have the authority to modify bus details, such as routes and timings. On the other hand, students will be able to access the app to view bus information and track buses in real-time.

## Document Conventions

Throughout this document, terms such as "must," "should," and "may" indicate the importance of a requirement. Use case descriptions will follow the format: "Actor" -> "Use Case" -> "Description."

## Intended Audience

The primary audience for this document includes developers, testers, and project stakeholders who are involved in the development and testing of the Bus Management System app.

## Product Overview

The Bus Management System app is designed to simplify the process of managing buses and enable students to track their buses. The app will have two main roles: teacher and student. Teachers can add, edit, and delete bus details, while students can view bus information and track their buses in real-time.

## Overall Description

### Product Perspective
